# IMPORTANT: Chrome (and other chromium browsers) handle this really poorly so i would recommend using firefox or safari. unless you want some crazy distortion.. then use chrome

## Draw:
Draw mode is selected by default, or by using the pink button in the top left corner. In draw mode, you can choose colors and stroke weight from the palette and create a drawing on the canvas. Additionally, the pink eraser button in the top right allows you to use the mouse to erase small details, or use the red "reset" button to completely clear the canvas.
## Synth:
Synth mode can be activated by pressing the blue "synth" button in the top left corner. In synth mode, instead of drawing on the canvas, you will now be able to click and drag the mouse over the drawing you made and the program will interpret it as music. In synth mode, you have options (on the right side of the palette) to alter the note speed, polyphony, and note length. The black "kill" button will completely end all currently playing notes (this will be useful when using the "hold" note length.)
